## 📚 Project Overview

This is a beginner-friendly command-line calculator built in Python. It was developed as my first project after completing the Coursera course "Programming for Everybody". The goal was to apply what I learned about functions, loops, and user interaction in a real-world context.

The calculator supports a wide range of arithmetic operations and is designed for repeated, interactive use in the terminal.
